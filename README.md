🛍️ Shopify Sales Data Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing a Shopify store's sales data to derive actionable insights. A business intelligence dashboard was created to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), track sales trends, and understand customer behavior.

📊 Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of the store's performance, focusing on profit, product categories, customer demographics, and payment methods.
